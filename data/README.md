# Dataset

The material properties used in [our paper] are downloaded from the following two public datasets and Matminer.

- The OQMD database [[link](http://oqmd.org/)]
- The JARVIS database [[link](https://jarvis.nist.gov/)]
- Matminer [[link](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/)]

As we cannot redistribute these two datasets, the datasets should be downloaded by the users and converted into proper format before use. Also, please cite the relevant papers as requested by the dataset authors.

We have provided a sample dataset with train/validation/test split and the datasets which was used in this work (along with exact training and test split) to run the code.
