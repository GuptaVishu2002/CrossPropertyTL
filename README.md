# ElemNet-TF2

This repository contains the code for performing activation extraction and model training along with various models trained on different materials property using Elemental Fraction (EF) as the model input. It is recommended to train large dataset (e.g. OQMD, MP) from scratch (SC) and small datasets (DFT-computed or experimental datasets) using transfer learning methods shown below:
